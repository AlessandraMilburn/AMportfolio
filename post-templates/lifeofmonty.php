      <h2>LIFE OF MONTY</h2>
      <h4>Informational Blog</h3>
      <p class="grey">4 weeks</p>
      <p>The Life of Monty website is created to share informational experiences of my French Bulldog named Monty and help other Frenchie owners through the challenges of caring for the sensitive breed. 
          It shares products that help ease the common breed problems, shares training tips to ease the
           dog and owner's life dynamic and shares the stories he's been through as an adopted dog.
      </p>
      <p>This is the very first no-guide project I have coded from scratch. Along the way I learned PHP and Wordpress.</p>

    <!--FEATURES-->
  <section>
    <h2>FEATURES</h2>
    <p>Created with wordpress, I wanted to design a layout where it tells a story per frame that describes each focus topic. 
      Each topic page is filtered by subtopic filter for a more organized display of posts. I added a social media carousel through widgets to display        Monty's updated social photos. And as this website's main source link is his Instagram account, it was important to make it mobile responsive.
