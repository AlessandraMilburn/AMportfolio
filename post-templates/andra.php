    <h2>BUSINESS SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>Andra ran for a little less than two years from building the concept, testing the market to becoming an e-commerce business. Andra is one of many low-cost e-commerce shops available in the market and one of the few that was profitable. While Andra performed successfully in a short period of time, it was forecasted to take a huge investment to compete with the current market leaders, due to this and other factors I have decided to exit the business, keep its assets and invest my time back to the workforce taking with me the skills and experiences that I have gained from Andra.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE GAINED</h2>
    <p>By building Andra, I gained detailed insight of what it takes to build a business from scratch. From sourcing a reliable supplier abroad, getting the business registered, designing creatives, branding, liaising with partners, social media management, customer service and relations, collaborations, budgeting, website design with Wix and Shopify, inventory management, photography, packaging design, and more. This experience has taught me that I am fully capable to successfully run a business and having said that, Andra is by far my most valuable achievement and experience as of date. I'm looking forward to surpassing it.</p>
