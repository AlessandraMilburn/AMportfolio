      <h2>MARKETING STRATEGY</h2>
      <br>
      <p>The case study with Marketing Strategy was required on the screening stage of the interview which asked us to identify the target market and build a marketing strategy around it. Out of a thousand applicants, this work stood out the most.</p>
      <p>The creation process of my case study started as gathering information from the internet to a Microsoft Excel file, then compiling relevant information to Microsoft Word and beautifying the file by combining text with imagery and creating a layout with the existing brand colors.</p>
      <p>PS. At the time, there was very limited information to be found online about the brand and the website was under construction only showing the brand logo and the starry background.</p>

      <h2>BRAND GUIDELINES</h2>
      <p>As the company develops, we play around with the brand colors and decide which best fits best to represent the brand. Proposed basic Brand Guidelines with 2 version, one in Gold and Grey and the other with Gold and Blue.</p>

    <!--EMAIL DESIGN-->

        <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mynextdress-emailproposed.png"/>
      </span>
      <h2>EMAIL DESIGN</h2>
      <p>The current design gave basic details but we felt that the transactional email could provide more information and can look and feel better in the eyes so I managed to create a design which includes the purchase details but also compliments the customer and gives them details of what to expect next. I also changed the look and feel of the design to a more luxurious, easy on the the eyes in addition to using the brand colors with the social media and customer service details which customers always find helpful.</p>

        <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mynextdress-websiteproposed.png"/>
      </span>
      <h2>WEB REDESIGN</h2>
      <p>The current design (screenshot unavailable) was out of date and did not explain the offer in one glance. This redesign gave all the information that educates the customer about what the business has to offer.</p>
      <p>Note that this design was produced via Wix website creator - this was prior my education and skills of coding websites from scratch.</p>
